# Customer_personality_clustering

## Introduction
I will perform the exploratory data analysis with the help of customer segmentation. Customer segmentation will be carried out with the help of K-Means alogorithm. At the end of analysis I would like to answer some questions by gaining some insights from the data.

## Describtion of the data

* NumStorePurchases - # of purchase made in store
* NumWebVisitsMonth - # of website visits in the last month
* AcceptedCmp1 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 1st campaign, 0 otherwise
* AcceptedCmp2 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 2nd campaign, 0 otherwise
* AcceptedCmp3 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 3rd campaign, 0 otherwise
* AcceptedCmp4 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 4th campaign, 0 otherwise
* AcceptedCmp5 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 5th campaign, 0 otherwise
* Response - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the last 
* ID - Customer's unique identification

* What are the statistical characteristics of the customers?
* What are the spending habits of the customers?
* Are there some products which need more marketing?
* How the marketing can be made effective?

## Step Inside The Project
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Machine Learning Model (K-Means)
* Cluster Interpretation
* Customer Distribution

* Most of the customers are university graduates.
* Most of the customers are living with partners.
* Those living alone have spent more than those living with partners.
* Most of the customers have only one child.
